<h1><b>World Wide Web</b></h1>
<p>The web is made up of you, your computer and browser, the internet and servers. You use your browser to make requests via the internet to servers. The requests use a protocol called <b> HTTP </b>.</p>
<p>The internet is the world's largest computer network. Servers are computers which host files.</p>
<p> To learn more, you can watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc"> THIS VIDEO</a> which describes how the internet works in a little more detail.</p>
<p><b>HTML</b>, or HyperText Markup Language, is made up of text content <em>(what you see)</em>, markup <em>(what it looks like)</em>, references to other documents <em>(i.e. images and videos)</em>, and links to other pages.</p>
<h1>Why Computers Are "Stupid"</h1>
<p>Computers do exactly what they are told. As a result, a small mistake in code can cause large problems. </p>
<h1>HTML Markup</h1>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>Some important tags to learn are <ul>
<li>bold: &ltb&gt &lt/b&gt</li>
  <li>italics: &ltem&gt &lt/em&gt</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Tags may have attributes. For example, the anchor tag which is used for making links has an attribute.</p>
<p>Note: a void tag (such as &ltbr&gt) does not have any content, therefore it does not need a closing tag </p>
<h2>Inline vs Block</h2>
<p>An <b>inline</b> element only takes up as much width as necessary, and does not force line breaks.</p>
<p>A <b>block</b> element is an element that takes up the full width available, and has a line break before and after it.</p>
